# TODO (Final Cleanup)

## Manual setup remaining

1. Configure GitHub `pypi` environment protections for tag releases.
2. Configure PyPI trusted publishing mapping for this repo/workflow.
3. Run first tagged release (`vX.Y.Z`) and verify publish/sign workflows.

## Backlog

4. Add `cybersec plan` to generate 30/60/90 remediation plan from current gaps.
